        "* **Introduction to pandas:** What is a **DataFrame**? Think of it like a table or a spreadsheet in Excel. A **DataFrame** is a 2D labeled data structure, like a spreadsheet with rows and columns. A single column is called a **Series**.\n",
        "* **Loading Data:** We'll use `pd.read_csv()` to load the `titanic_dataset.csv` file into a DataFrame. This is the first step in any data analysis project.\n",
        "* **Initial Data Inspection:** We'll use key methods to get a feel for our data:\n",
        "    * `.head()` to get a quick preview of the top rows.\n",
        "    * `.info()` to check data types and see if we have any missing values.\n",
        "    * `.describe()` to get a statistical summary of the numerical columns.\n",

        "### Part 2: Data Selection & Filtering (Finding Passengers)\n",

        "    * Single column: `df['ColumnName']`\n",
        "    * Multiple columns: `df[['Col1', 'Col2']]`\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Handling Missing Values:** Real-world data is messy! We'll learn how to identify missing values with `.isna().sum()` and how to deal with them by filling them in with `.fillna()` or dropping them with `.dropna()`.\n",
        "* **Creating New Columns:** We can add new columns to our DataFrame based on calculations from existing ones. This is a powerful way to add new insights.\n",
